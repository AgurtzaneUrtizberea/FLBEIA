Description: A simulation toolbox that describes a fishery system under
    a Management Strategy Estrategy approach.The objective of the model is
    to facilitate the Bio-Economic evaluation of Management strategies. It is
    multistock, multifleet and seasonal. The simulation is divided in 2 main blocks,
    the Operating Model (OM) and the Management Procedure (MP). In turn, these
    two bloack are divided in 3 components, the biological, the fleets and the
    covariables components on the one hand and the observation, the assessment and
    the advice on the other.
